===============================

Demonstrates Akka streams wrapper for Apache Kafka: https://github.com/softwaremill/reactive-kafka

For full description check the [tutorial](./tutorial/index.html).

# Improvements
I felt that there were improvements to be made to the tutorial.
* handling multiple subscribers
* sink that writes back to the kafka
* writing to multiple kafka topics

I have made improvements to cater for these in the pull request.

Please feel free to take out this comment and make any more improvements.
